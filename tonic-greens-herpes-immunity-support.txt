# Tonic Greens – Natural Immune Support for Herpes (2025)

This is not medical advice. Just compiling what I found after years of trial and error dealing with HSV-1 and HSV-2 flare-ups.

The only thing that gave me balance was when I stopped focusing on killing the virus, and started supporting my immune system.

## Key Ingredients in Tonic Greens (Dr. Ryan Shelton):

- Spirulina – antioxidant & antiviral properties
- Camu Camu – extremely high vitamin C concentration
- Green Tea Extract – supports immune function, antioxidant
- Beet Root – blood flow and detox support
- Turmeric – anti-inflammatory, balances immune response
- Resveratrol – longevity compound with immune modulation potential

## What I noticed:

- Less fatigue
- Better digestion
- No new outbreaks during 4 weeks
- Mental clarity
- Less bloating

Not a cure. But the first thing that felt like real support.

Save if you're looking into natural herpes management options.
